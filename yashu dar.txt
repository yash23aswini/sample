The "dar computer language" is actually the Dart programming language, an open-source, object-oriented language developed by Google for building fast, cross-platform applications. Dart supports server-side, mobile, desktop, and web development, but is most widely known for powering the Flutter framework, which enables the creation of beautiful and performant mobile, web, and desktop apps from a single codebase.  
Key Characteristics
Cross-Platform: Dart can compile to native machine code for mobile and desktop (using frameworks like Flutter) or to JavaScript/WebAssembly for web development. 
Familiar Syntax: Its C-style syntax is similar to Java, C++, and JavaScript, making it relatively easy for developers to learn. 
Productivity Features: Dart includes features like "stateful hot reload" in the Flutter framework, which allows developers to see the results of code changes instantly without restarting the app. 
Type Safety: Dart is a strongly typed language with features like null safety, helping to prevent common programming errors. 
Open Source and Google-Backed: As an open-source project backed by Google, it has strong long-term prospects for development and adoption.
